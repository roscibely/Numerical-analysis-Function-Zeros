## Introduction to Numerical Analysis

This is from my course Numerical Analysis.

    Part I 
    
    I. Numerical erros
    
    II. Zeros of Functions Methods
        1. Bissection method;
        2. Newton method; 
        3. Secant method.
    
    Part II 
    
    I. Methods to solve linear systems
        1. LU decomposition
        2. Gauss elimination
        3. Jordan-Guass method
        4. Gauss-Seidel method
    
    II. Polynomial-Interpolation
        1. Lagrange method
        A way to find a polynomial which takes on certain values at arbitrary points
        2. Newton method

    III. Least squares method (LSM)
    
    Part III 
    
    I. Integration techniques
         1. Newton-Cotes formulas

            iii. Simpson's 3/8 rule 
            iv.  Boole's Rule
        2.  Gaussian Quadrature
        
    II. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) 
    
        1. Euler method 
        2. Runge-kutta methods (2,3, and 4)
